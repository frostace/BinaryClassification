  * We can tell apart a dog from a cat immediately with a glance, but what if we cannot see the whole picture, we are just allowed to ask yes or no questions??
  
  * This is basically the main idea of decision tree.
  
  * Discuss a little about find_best_question, give program flow chart
  
  * Discuss Simple Decision tree performance
  
    * Acc

      Problem: Looks good, but cutoff is not working, try printing true rate values
      
      Possible reasons:
      
	    1. ~~Overfitting~~, i changed the gini convergence condition to gini <= 0.01
      
      2. Unbalanced input data
      
         â€‹	F-measure = 0.284839

    * Overall Performance
      
      * Max Acc = 63% | cutoff in [0.65, 0.7]
    
      * AUC = 0.669
